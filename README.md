# üöÄ AWS Services

## üîê **AWS Console and Access Management**

* **Login URL**: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_si&region=us-east-2&src=header-signin#
* In the top bar, you can select regions, which correspond to AWS datacenters. Usually, AWS allocates us to the closest region, but it's possible to choose other available locations. However, there may be differences in available products and service prices. Ohio region is a good choice.
* Also in the top bar, you can click on your username and check the billing dashboard and your access keys;
* AWS access keys allow you to access your AWS account without needing your username and password;
* When a user is created in AWS, they are considered the root user. From this user, it's possible to create other users with specific accesses. A security practice is to avoid creating access keys for the main administrator user, creating them only for other users;
* After creating them, it's better to download as .csv, mainly because the secret access key is only visible once;
* It's also a good practice to deactivate the key when you're not using it.

## üñ•Ô∏è **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

* **AMI** = Machine Image
* Steps to create a virtual machine in EC2:
  * Software Configuration (operating system, e.g., Linux)
  * Hardware Configuration (memory, RAM...)
  * Access Key Configuration (create new key pair > RSA > .pem)
  * Network Configuration (to communicate with other machines)
  * Storage Configuration + Additional disks
  * Optional: additional details (like restart in case of failures, monitoring...)
* To create key pairs that allow access to instances, go to the left sidebar in EC2, scroll down to Network & Security > Key Pairs > Create Key Pair > Select RSA and .pem >
* Interestingly, when I click on a running instance, there's a "Connect" button that shows how I can remotely access the instance via terminal; (If you have the access key and the security group is correctly defined, in the first tab after clicking connect and clicking again, a browser page appears with a terminal for the instance!)
* An instance created without a registered key pair cannot be accessed remotely, and it's not possible to add this configuration later.
* Every EC2 is associated with a security group (at least one is created when the account is created). In the lower part of the EC2 interface, there are Inbound Rules and Outbound Rules options, which are associated with a security group (usually I don't need to configure these parameters manually, AWS has default values, HOWEVER, these default values don't allow remote connection to instances, so it's better to configure them).
* **TO CONFIGURE SECURITY TO ALLOW CONNECTION IN THE INTERFACE**: Instance page > scroll down to the bottom panel > Security > Security Group ID > click on the ID box that appears > Edit inbound rules > Add rule > Type: SSH, Source: Anywhere-IPv4 > Save rules.

## üåê **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**

* Whenever an account is created in AWS, a VPC is also created.
* Every EC2 resource is obligatorily within a VPC.
* Within a VPC, it's possible to configure subnets (and they are also created, but can be configured). Each subnet also has an IP range.
* For a machine to communicate, it needs to be in a network of machines.
* Is it also related to Security Groups?

## üì¶ **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

* Every time I create a bucket in S3, which consequently allows me to store my data, this bucket must have a unique name across the entire Amazon service. At least if it's destroyed, it becomes available again.
* Although EC2 stores files, the cost of this is much higher compared to S3.

## üê≥ **Elastic Container Service (ECS)**

* Container Orchestration in the cloud.
* I need to create a cluster to create containers.
* After creating a cluster, it can be configured as a Service or a Task, which in turn can be created when we click on "" OR "Run Task" > "Task Definition" > "Task Definitions" > "Create New Task Definition" > , respectively.

#### **Resource - ALB (Application Load Balancer)**
* Load balancing service offered by AWS, designed for modern microservices-based applications, with support for HTTP and HTTPS protocols;
* To summarize better, it helps with servers/sites that multiple people will use.
* Frequently, the ALB's target groups will be containers we want to create, and there's also the whole issue of listener definition to connect the two.
* Once I have an application available with the ALB DNS, I can access it from alb_dns_name.aws.amazon.com. To personalize the site address, it's possible to use the Route 53 service, also from AWS, but completely paid.

## ‚ö° **AWS Fargate**

* It's a serverless/infrastructure-less solution.
* It can be used when creating clusters in AWS without the person needing to define infrastructure, but it's also a more expensive service than others that use infrastructure.

## üìä **CloudWatch**

* Monitoring service for other AWS services;

## üë§ **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

* Service to create security users in AWS, completely free.
* In translation, Role = Function.
* To create: in the sidebar Access Management > Roles > Create Role > AWS Service (a role that will be used internally for communication between AWS services) > Select Use Case (e.g., Elastic Container Service) > should appear more specific use options (e.g., Elastic Container Service Task) > Permission Policies (e.g., AmazonECS_FullAccess + AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy + AmazonS3FullAccess) > Create role name (e.g., ecsTaskExecutionRole).

## üìà **EMR (Elastic Map Reduce)**

* Originally, creating an Apache Spark cluster and other similar services can be quite laborious; using Amazon EMR makes it much easier, especially since it requires having robust machines.
* It's a completely charged service; in billing, it's the cost of Hardware (EC2) and Software (EMR), and it has to be good hardware...
* There's also a serverless version with even fewer configurations.
* It's a type of service that requires two layers of security, one internal (IAM) and one external (Security Group), since the cluster will be available on the internet.
* The cost of Amazon EMR is composed of several components:
  - EC2 Instance Cost: You pay for the instances you use, with various types to choose from.
  - Storage Cost: This includes data storage in S3 or local storage instances.
  - Data Transfer Fees: If you transfer data outside AWS, this incurs additional costs.
  - Other fees: Some additional frameworks or applications may have extra costs.

# üê≥ **Docker Usage and Key Concepts**

## Container Operations

### Basic Ubuntu Container Execution
To run an Ubuntu terminal environment:
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

### Container Management Commands
- `docker ps`: Displays all currently running containers
- `docker run` options:
  - `--name`: Assigns a specific name to the container
  - `-it`: Interactive mode, opening a terminal session for direct interaction
  - `-d`: Detached mode, executing the container in the background
  - `-p`: Port mapping configuration (virtual_port:local_port)

## Dockerfile Fundamentals

The Dockerfile serves as a blueprint for creating Docker images, though it notably lacks a file extension. This design choice reflects its specialized purpose within the Docker ecosystem.

The image creation process requires executing `docker build`, which constructs an image from the Dockerfile specifications. The `FROM PYTHON` directive initiates image creation based on an existing Python image, which subsequently executes the specified script.

The trailing period in build commands (`.`) instructs Docker to locate the Dockerfile in the current directory. During execution, `docker run` first searches for images locally before querying Docker Hub if no local match is found.

## Docker Compose for Multi-Service Management

Docker Compose enables orchestration of multiple services through a single configuration file:

- `-p`: Assigns a project name to the container cluster
- `up`: Creates and starts containers (requires pre-existing or downloadable images)
- `down`: Stops and removes containers
- `-d`: Detached mode operation for background execution

The initial `docker-compose up` execution may require additional time, while subsequent runs benefit from cached layers, resulting in significantly improved performance.

## Disk Management and Cache Usage

As Docker operates, it progressively stores cache data on the hard drive, which can rapidly consume significant storage space. Despite the storage impact, this caching mechanism significantly accelerates subsequent Dockerfile executions, reducing what were previously extended processing times. Verification with `docker system df` to confirm the storage utilized.

# üèóÔ∏è **Terraform**

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) is an Infrastructure as Code (**IaC**) management platform. The platform allows you to write code in your preferred programming language to describe your infrastructure in terms of resources, such as servers, networks, and storage volumes. Terraform uses this description to create and manage these resources across multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, among others. One of Terraform's main advantages is that it allows you to manage your infrastructure abstractly, **independent of the specific cloud provider**. This means that, with a single code description, you can manage your infrastructure across multiple cloud providers and even migrate your resources from one provider to another. Furthermore, Terraform allows for code versioning, making change control and rollback easier. And Terraform is free.

## üìÅ **Basic Terraform Structure**

### üìÑ **Configuration Files**
- **Extension**: `.tf`
- **Main file**: `main.tf` - defines resources and providers
- **Variables**: `variables.tf` - variable declaration
- **Values**: `terraform.tfvars` - variable value assignment
- **Outputs**: `outputs.tf` - displays information after execution

### üóëÔ∏è **Files to Ignore in Git**
```gitignore
# .gitignore for Terraform
.terraform/
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
.terraform.lock.hcl
.DS_Store  # üçé macOS folder system file
```

**üí° It's even important to delete the `.DS_Store` file frequently.**

### üîß **Fundamental Commands**
```bash
terraform init    # üèÅ Initializes project (creates .terraform/ and .terraform.lock.hcl)
terraform apply   # üöÄ Applies automation
terraform destroy # üí• Destroys resources (--auto-approve skips confirmation)
```

## üèóÔ∏è **HCL Structure (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**

### üìù **Main Blocks**
```hcl
# Provider (no longer mandatory in recent versions)
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}

# Resource - defines cloud resources
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-*****************"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  key_name      = var.key_pair
}

# Variable - declares variables
variable "instance_count" {
  description = "Number of instances"
  type        = number
  default     = 1
}
```

## üéØ **Recommended File Standards**

### üìã **Ideal Structure**
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf          # üîß Main resources
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf     # üìä Variable declaration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfvars # ‚öôÔ∏è Variable values
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf       # üì§ Project outputs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore       # üôà Ignores .terraform/, .tfstate, .DS_Store
```

## üîÑ **Multiple Instance Creation**

### üë• **Method 1: Count**
```hcl
variable "instance_count" {
  description = "Number of EC2 instances"
  type        = number
  default     = 3
}

variable "create_instance" {
  description = "Flag to create instances"
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  count = var.create_instance ? var.instance_count : 0  # üéØ Conditional
  
  ami           = "ami-*****************"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer-${count.index}"  # üè∑Ô∏è Unique name for each
  }
}
```

### üó∫Ô∏è **Method 2: For Each**
```hcl
variable "web_servers" {
  description = "Web servers configuration"
  type = map(object({
    name = string
  }))
  default = {
    "server1" = { name = "Server1" }
    "server2" = { name = "Server2" }
    "server3" = { name = "Server3" }
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  for_each = var.web_servers  # üîÑ Iterates over map
  
  ami           = "ami-*****************"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = each.value.name  # üè∑Ô∏è Uses map name
  }
}
```

## üì§ **Outputs and Modules**

### üìä **Output Block**
```hcl
output "instance_ids" {
  description = "IDs of created instances"
  value       = aws_instance.web_server.*.id  # üåü Lists all IDs
}
```
**Command**: `terraform output`

### üß© **Module Structure**
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf               # üì¶ Defines modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ec2_instances/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf       # üîß Module resources
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf
```

**Usage in main.tf**:
```hcl
module "ec2_instances" {
  source = "./modules/ec2_instances"
  instance_count = 3
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
```

## ‚ö° **Provisioners**

### üïí **Provisioner Types**
- **Creation-Time**: Executes during resource creation
- **Destroy-Time**: Executes during destruction (`when = destroy`)

### üìÅ **File Provisioner**
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "conf/myapp.conf"
    destination = "/etc/myapp.conf"
    
    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ec2-user"
      private_key = file("key.pem")
      host        = self.public_ip
    }
  }
}
```

### üíª **Local-Exec Provisioner - Practical Example**

**üìÅ Project Structure**:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ upload_to_s3.sh
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IaC/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dsa_iac_deploy/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
```

**üîß Terraform Implementation**:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "dsa_bucket_flask" {
  bucket = "unique-bucket-name" 
  force_destroy = true  # üóëÔ∏è Allows destroying non-empty bucket
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "DSA Bucket"
    Environment = "Lab4"
  }

  # üì§ Upload during creation
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "chmod +x ${path.module}/upload_to_s3.sh && ${path.module}/upload_to_s3.sh"
  }

  # üßπ Cleanup during destruction
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    when    = destroy
    command = "aws s3 rm s3://unique-bucket-name --recursive"
  }
}
```

**üìú upload_to_s3.sh Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# üìÇ Recursive upload to S3
aws s3 cp IaC/dsa_iac_deploy/ s3://unique-bucket-name/ --recursive

# üóÇÔ∏è Structure uploaded:
# IaC/dsa_iac_deploy/
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # üêç Flask application
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # üì¶ Python dependencies
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/          # üé® HTML templates
#     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
#     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ results.html
```

### üåê **Remote-Exec Provisioner**
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-*****************"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo yum update -y",
      "sudo yum install httpd -y", 
      "sudo systemctl start httpd",
      "sudo bash -c 'echo Web Server with Terraform > /var/www/html/index.html'"
    ]
    
    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ec2-user"
      private_key = file("key.pem")
      host        = self.public_ip
    }
  }
}
```

## üîê **Security Groups**

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Configuration**
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  name        = "allow-http-ssh"
  description = "Allows HTTP and SSH"
  
  ingress {
    description = "HTTP"
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # üåç Any IP
  }
  
  ingress {
    description = "SSH"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp" 
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 65535  # üì° All output ports
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **User Data as Alternative**

### üìú **Initialization Script**
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  ami           = "ami-*****************"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  
  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              sudo yum update -y
              sudo yum install httpd -y
              sudo systemctl start httpd
              sudo systemctl enable httpd
              sudo bash -c 'echo Web Server with Terraform > /var/www/html/index.html'
              EOF
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è **ECS Cluster Creation**

### üîß **Main Components**
- **`aws_ecs_cluster`**: Defines the cluster
- **`aws_ecs_task_definition`**: Configures tasks
- **`aws_ecs_service`**: Manages the service
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: `aws_lb` + `aws_lb_target_group` + `aws_lb_listener`

### üí° **Considerations**
- **Health checks** integrate with CloudWatch
- **IAM roles** can be created via Terraform
- **Security groups** need specific configuration
- **Cost**: Most expensive part of infrastructure
- **Auto-termination**: Important for cost control

## üåç **Availability Zones**

### üìç **High Availability**
```hcl
# constants.tf
variable "availability_zones" {
  description = "Availability zones"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["us-east-2a", "us-east-2b", "us-east-2c"]
}
```

**Benefits**:
- üõ°Ô∏è Fault tolerance
- üîß Maintenance without downtime
- üìà Load distribution

## üìä **Terraform Graph**

### üîç **Dependency Visualization**
```bash
terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png  # üñºÔ∏è Generates image
```

**Online tool**: http://webgraphviz.com/

## üê≥ **Practical Example with Docker**

### üöÄ **Complete Execution Flow**
```bash
# üìÇ Navigate to module directory
cd devops-iac/

# 1. üèóÔ∏è Build Docker image
docker build -t terraform-image:lab .

# 2. üê≥ Run container

# AWS Access Key ID: ********************
# AWS Secret Access Key: ***************************************
# Region: us-east-2

# 5. ‚úÖ Test AWS configuration
aws s3 ls | awk '{print $NF}'

# 6. üîß Check Terraform version
terraform version

# 7. üìÅ Navigate to laboratory
cd lab

# 8. üèÅ Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# 9. üöÄ Apply configuration
terraform apply

# 10. üí• Destroy resources (when needed)
terraform destroy
```

### üîé **Useful AWS Commands**
```bash
# üìã List Amazon Linux 2 AMIs
AWS_PAGER="" aws ec2 describe-images \
  --owners amazon \
  --filters "Name=name,Values=amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2" \
  --query 'Images[?ImageLocation.contains(@, `amazon`)].{Name:Name,ID:ImageId}' \
